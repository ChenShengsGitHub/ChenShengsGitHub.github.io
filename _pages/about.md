I am a fourth-year doctoral student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). My research interests include machine learning, protein structure prediction, protein design, and drug molecular generation.

I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Professor Yuedong Yang at Sun Yat-sen University. I anticipate completing my doctoral studies by July 2024. Currently, I am seeking postdoctoral positions and look forward to continuing my research in AI4Science during my postdoctoral tenure.

* **2024/9**  My work **EModelX** has recently been accepted by **Nature Communications**! EModelX is a fully automated cryo-EM protein complex structure modeling method. It has been compared with the SOTA method [ModelAngelo](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07215-4) and showed outperformance in comprehensive metrics. ##[Read it](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53116-5) or [Use it](https://bio-web1.nscc-gz.cn/app/EModelX).
