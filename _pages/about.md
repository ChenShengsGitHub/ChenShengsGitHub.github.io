I am Sheng (Shawn) Chen, a fourth-year doctoral student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/china/computer-science?name=Sun+Yat+sen+University). My research interests include _machine learning for protein structure prediction, protein design, and drug design_.

I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Professor Yuedong Yang at Sun Yat-sen University. I anticipate completing my doctoral studies by July 2025. I am currently seeking research positions. My primary objective is to continue exploring _machine learning for life science_â€”a field I am deeply passionate about.

If you're interested in collaborating with me, feel free to download my [resume](/files/resume.pdf) for more information.
