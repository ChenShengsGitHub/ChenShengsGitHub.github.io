I am a fourth-year doctoral student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). My research interests include machine learning, protein structure prediction, protein design, and drug molecular generation.

I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Professor Yuedong Yang at Sun Yat-sen University. I anticipate completing my doctoral studies by July 2024. Currently, I am seeking postdoctoral positions and look forward to continuing my research in AI4Science during my postdoctoral tenure.
